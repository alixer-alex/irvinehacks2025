Very cool and awsome project


Need to run the backend and frontend at the same time.

To do so:
    Note) For if you don’t have a session.json: cd into backend. In terminal, type py first_time_login.py

    1) cd into backend. Then, in the terminal, type py app.py

    2) cd into frontend, IN A DIFFERENT TERMINAL. type npm run dev.

        You may have to do npm install within the frontend folder, if npm is not installed. You should only have to do this once in the frontend folder, on your machine. No need to repeat it each time you restart your IDE or whatever.

    3) Now click the link produced in the terminal where you ran npm run dev. Test it!

If you’d like to actually use the deployed version of the app, check the Discord group chat pinned messages. It is on vercel.
